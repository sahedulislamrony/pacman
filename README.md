# üéÆ Pacman Game in Java

Welcome to the **Pacman Game in Java**, a fully functional Pac-Man clone built using **Java** and **Java Swing**. This project follows a structured approach with routing, state management, and a dynamic game environment.

## üìö Introduction

This game brings the classic Pac-Man experience to life with smooth controls and a well-structured architecture. Users can navigate Pac-Man through a maze while avoiding ghosts and collecting points.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Full Pac-Man Game** implemented using Java and Java Swing.
- **AppRouter** to manage page navigation and state transfer.
- **GameData** class to distribute data using a **Consumer-Listener model**.
- **Modular Architecture** with separate classes for `Block`, `GameMap`, etc.
- **Smooth Player Controls** using arrow keys.
- **Multiple Pages**:
  - Welcome Page
  - Game Page (Main Pac-Man Game)
  - Game Over Page
  - Settings Page (WIP)
  - Profile Page (WIP)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Controls

| Key | Action     |
| --- | ---------- |
| ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  | Move Up    |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è  | Move Down  |
| ‚¨ÖÔ∏è  | Move Left  |
| ‚û°Ô∏è  | Move Right |

## üîÆ Upcoming Features

- **Optimized Routing System** for better state management.
- **Profile System** to save and display player information.
- **Sound System** to enhance gameplay experience.
- **Settings Page** for customizing game preferences.
- **Unique Ghost Movement AI** to make the game more challenging.

## üß† What I Have Learned

- Implementing a **Consumer-Listener model** for state management.
- Building a **routing system** in Java for page navigation.
- Creating an interactive **game environment using Java Swing**.
- Structuring a project for **scalability and maintainability**.

## About This Project

The **Pacman Game** in **Java** is a fully functional recreation of the classic **Pac-Man** arcade game, built using **Java** and **Java Swing**. This project showcases my ability to implement structured game development concepts, including **page routing**, **state management**, and **object-oriented programming**. The game features smooth player controls, multiple pages, and a modular architecture that ensures scalability and maintainability.
